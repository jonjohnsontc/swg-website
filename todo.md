# SWG Website Next Steps-a-palooza

So far, I have an api setup, which allows for the retreval of information within the swg of songwriters by name (search), songwriters by wid, and neighbors by wid. Next, I'd like to build a frontend that will retrieve that information, along with a simple UI.

[] Define routes like conan (do i need to do this?)
[] Create view that will show neighbors for a writer

## What do I want to do tonight?
